This project has six separate problems, with six separate spec files. Run
them in the following order:

1. `00_hello_friend_spec.rb`
1. `00_book_titles_spec.rb`
1. `00_timer_spec.rb`
1. `00_temperature_object_spec.rb`
1. `00_dictionary_spec.rb`
1. `00_my_hash_set_spec.rb`

Instructions for each problem are in the spec file.

Remember, the way you run the tests is by navigating to the project's root
directory (the directory with the `README`, the `lib` folder, and the `spec`
folder) and running `bundle exec rspec` in terminal.

You can run just the specs in a single spec file by running `bundle exec rspec
file_name.rb` in terminal (e.g., `bundle exec rspec
hello_spec.rb`).

You can run just one spec or set of specs by running `bundle exec rspec
file_name.rb:line_number` in terminal (e.g., `bundle exec rspec
hello_spec.rb:3`).
